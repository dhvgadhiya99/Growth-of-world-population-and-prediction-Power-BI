<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on analyzing the growth of the world population and making predictions for the future. The team collected data from various sources, including the United Nations, to explore factors contributing to population growth and its implications on social, economic, and environmental aspects.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The world population has experienced rapid growth, reaching eight billion in November 2022, compared to six million in 1999. The project utilized agile methodology and Gantt charts for project planning, followed by exploratory data analysis to clean the dataset. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of top five countries by population.</li>
<li>Analysis of factors impacting population growth, such as birth rate, death rate, fertility rate, literacy rate, and healthcare expenditure.</li>
<li>Projection of future population trends for the top five countries until 2100.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The United Nations predicts a global population of 9.7 billion by 2050 and 10.9 billion by 2100. This growth poses challenges in various sectors, including food security, healthcare, urbanization, climate change, and biodiversity loss.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The team employed a structured work methodology and divided tasks among members to conduct in-depth analysis. Major topics covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Future population projection of the top five countries.</li>
<li>Birth rate, death rate, and fertility rate analysis.</li>
<li>Percentage of GDP spent on healthcare.</li>
<li>Literacy rate trends.</li>
</ul>
